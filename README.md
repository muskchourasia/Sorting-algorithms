# Sorting-algorithms
Write a generalized function that takes a parameter to indicate the mode (say 1 for decreasing order, 2 for increasing order, 
3 for increasing order with the Nth element out of order,4 for a randomly generated element values), to create a list of elements. The parameter 
indicating the number of elements in a statically allocated array (the maximum size is large enough to run possible iterarations to test the time complexity, say 1000000)
will be a multiple of 10. Also write appropriate functions to create a copy of the list and to display the list contents.
Using above functions, write a menu-driven C program to order the list in ascending sequence using - the Bubble Sort, the Insertion Sort, the Selection Sort, 
the Shell Sort,Quick Sort,Heap Sort and Merge Sort.
